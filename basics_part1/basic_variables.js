accountCity = "alwar "; //by default it is declared as var in javascript 

// we usually use to go for let not for the var one 
// var varible not used becouse at older time it dont understand the block scope things it create a golbal vaiable
// this may cause some problems of changing the variable of one scope in  the affect of othe scope
